# Examples

## List of examples
To run this examples use either the Arduino IDE or something similar like the [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/platformio-ide?utm_source=github&utm_medium=xmc-for-arduino) module for [code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [atom](https://atom.io/)
* examples/basicTest/rampTest.ino - runs a basic controller and shield test with one motor attached in forward and backward direction and with speed ramping.
* examples/control2Motors/control2Motors.ino - This examples show how to control more than one motor.
* examples/rampSpeedTest/rampSpeedTest.ino - Ramps a motor which is connected to two half bridges up and down in forward and backward direction.
* examples/speedControl/speedControl.ino - Show how to control a motor only with the basic library.
* 
* all Arduino sketches are also available for the other included platforms. See below the src/framework/PLATFORM directory.

## DIY-projects
* there are two Lego robots using the TLE94112 shields for controlling motors.
 * a [Lego rama driving robot](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/tools/landing/infineon-for-makers/diy-projects/) 
 * a [Lego six axes robot](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/tools/landing/infineon-for-makers/diy-projects/)
