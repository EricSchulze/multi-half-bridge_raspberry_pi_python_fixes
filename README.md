Library of Infineon's [DC Motor Shield with TLE94112EL](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/evaluation-boards/tle94112el_shield/) for Arduino.

## Summary
The DC motor shield is a small evaluation board equipped with TLE94112EL for use with Arduino. The TLE94112EL is capable to drive up to 6
small DC motors in parallel mode or up to 11 DC motors in cascaded mode. All outputs can drive up to 0.9A. The outputs can be used stand-alone
or combined to increase driving capability up to 3.6A. The implemented integrated [TLE94112EL](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/power/motor-control-ics/intelligent-motor-control-ics/multi-half-bridge-ics/tle94112el/)
is a protected twelve-fold half-bridge driver designed especially for automotive motion control applications such as Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) flap DC motor control.

## Key Features and Benefits
* Driver with 12 half-bridge outputs to drive DC motors, resistive or inductive loads
* Driver is protected against over-temperature, over-current, over-voltage, under-voltage and enables diagnosis of over-current, over-voltage, under-voltage
* SPI interface with zero clock diagnosis
* Enhanced EMC performance
* Integrated PWM generator with 3 different frequencies (80Hz, 100Hz, 200Hz)
* Shield enables compact design for multi-motor applications
* Efficient design for multi-motor applications
* Less communication with ÂµC through integrated PWM generator and zero clock diagnosis
* Reducing external components to meet EMC requirements
* The board is stackabel if you change the position of a resistor, [see here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/infineon/assets/master/Pictures/TLE94112_Arduino_Shield_Pin_out.png)
* LED driver on the first half-bridge

## Target Applications:
* Multi-motor applications
* DC motors and voltage controlled bipolar stepper motors
* Toys
* HVAC systems

## Usage
Please follow the example sketches in the /examples directory in this library to learn more about the usage of the library.
For proper work of the TLE94112 the following tips may help:
* the TLE94112 works properly in the range of min 5.5V to max 40V Vbat
* the max current on one half bridge is 0.9 A, if you need more you have to cascade more half bridges, see [manual](https://www.infineon.com/dgdl/Infineon-TLE94112EL-DS-v01_00-EN.pdf?fileId=5546d462576f347501579a2795837d3e) and pin out picture
* the shield is stackable if you change the 0 \Omega resistor from R7/R8.
* there is also a hack to stack a max number of three TLE94112 (please ask if you need this)
* the first two ports can be directly used also for LEDs but with the help of right dimensioned resistors, any half bridge can be used
for LEDs or other stuff falling in the voltage and current limits of the board
* there is a handy [pin out picture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/infineon/assets/master/Pictures/TLE94112_Arduino_Shield_Pin_out.png)
